# Link Prediction via Higher-Order Motif Features

This repository contains the code and scripts required to replicate the experiments that are reported in the paper titled "Link Prediction via Higher-Order Motif Features".
 The code includes:
1. Sample a set of positive edges from the dataset.
2. Sample a set of negative edges from the dataset.
3. Preparing the graph dataset in the input format of the <strong> Arabesque </strong> framework (http://arabesque.io/). 

* These steps can be done using src/Sampling.java file using the following commands:
     *   ##### Compile:
                javac Sampling.java
     *   ##### Run:
                java Sampling <input graph file>  <number of edges in the sample>
     *   ##### Example:
                java Sampling Graph.txt 1000

4. Extracting motifs. In this project, we use <strong> Arabesque </strong> framework (http://arabesque.io/). Any framework can be used for extracting the motifs from the graph.

5. Aggregating motifs for each edge in the sample (positive and negative).
* The Aggregation can be done using src/Aggregation.java file using the following commands:
     *   ##### Compile:
                javac Aggregation.java
     *   ##### Run:
                java Aggregation <arabesque output file>  <pattren file output>  <features file output>
     *   ##### Example:
                java Aggregation arabesque_output pattren_found motifs_Edges
6. Computing different graph techniuqes for link prediction including: (Common Neighbors, Jaccard Coefficient, Adamic/Adar,    Preferential Attachment,  Rooted PageRank, Katz Index).
